# Food Point Usage Dashboard Project

This is the main folder for the OutOfTheBoxPlots' Second Project on Duke 
students' Food Point Utilization. Our goal is to build a Shiny dashboard app 
that takes Duke studentsâ€™ food plan data and generates a report on their usage. 
Our dashboard app can be found [here](http://mralph15.shinyapps.io/dashboard).
A write-up of the project can be found as a tab on the dashboard.
