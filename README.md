# Food Point Usage Dashboard Project

This is the main folder for the OutOfTheBoxPlots' Second Project on Duke 
students' Food Point Utilization. Readers will find a Shiny dashboard app 
that takes Duke undergraduate studentsâ€™ food plan data and generates a report on 
their usage, allowing students to set and inform any food point spending goals 
they may have. Our dashboard app can be found at [bit.ly/duke-food-point-tracker](http://mralph15.shinyapps.io/dashboard).
A write-up of the project can be found as a tab on the dashboard.
